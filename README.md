# Hi, I’m Pedro Silva
Data Scientist focused on gaming analytics: gameplay insights, retention, monetization, experimentation, and player voice.

## What I do
I build end-to-end data science projects that mirror how game studios work with data:
- Gameplay and balance analytics (match outcomes, skill signals, meta drivers)
- Product analytics (cohorts, retention, churn risk)
- Monetization analytics (segmentation, value/KPI movement)
- Experimentation (A/B testing, lift estimation, guardrails)
- Player voice (NLP on reviews, drivers of sentiment)
- Community analytics (viewer–creator dynamics, engagement signals)

Goal: Predict match outcome using early-match signals and explain what drives wins.  
Skills: Feature engineering, classification, calibration, interpretability (SHAP), insight writing  

Dataset: League of Legends (Kaggle)  

Repo: (WIP)  
Deliverables: Model card, evaluation notebook, short insights report (PDF)

### 2) Retention and Churn Risk — Cohorts and Early Warning Scoring

Skills: NLP preprocessing, topic modeling/embeddings, interpretable modeling, trend analysis  

Dataset: Steam reviews (Kaggle)  

Repo: (WIP)

### 5) Community Analytics — Twitch Interaction Graphs and Engagement

<img width="768" height="229" alt="community_analysis" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed0b9481-a3ba-4bf1-81f7-19d5487b76ab" />

Goal: Model viewer–streamer interactions and build community health metrics and segments.  

Skills: Graph analytics, community detection, time-based features, forecasting (optional)  

Dataset: Twitch interactions (Kaggle)  

Repo: WIP

### 6) Live Ops Reporting — Monthly Game Health Dashboard

<img width="768" height="229" alt="live_ops" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/619004a0-a450-4507-8602-1c5dc9b67060" />

Goal: Produce a monthly report with KPI definitions and a reproducible pipeline.  

Skills: Metrics design, data modeling, pipelines, BI-style reporting  

Data: Derived from the projects above  

Repo: (WIP)  

Deliverables: `metrics.md`, `report.pdf`, dashboard screenshots

---

## Toolbox
Python: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, statsmodels  
NLP: spaCy, transformers (as needed), topic modeling  
Experimentation: hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, guardrails, SRM checks  
Data: SQL, data modeling, reproducible pipelines  
Visualization: notebooks and BI-style reports

---

## How I structure projects
Most repos include:
- README (problem → data → method → results → decision)
- `metrics.md` with KPI definitions
- `notebooks/` (EDA → modeling → insights)
- `src/` for reusable code
- a short `report.pdf`
- `requirements.txt` and reproducible runs
